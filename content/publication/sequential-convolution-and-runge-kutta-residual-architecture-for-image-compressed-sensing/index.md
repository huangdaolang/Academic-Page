abstract: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have empowered Compressed
  Sensing (CS) substantially and have achieved high reconstruction quality and
  speed far exceeding traditional CS methods. However, there are still lots of
  issues to be further explored before it can be practical enough. There are
  mainly two challenging problems in CS, one is to achieve efficient data
  sampling, and the other is to reconstruct images with high-quality. To address
  the two challenges, this paper proposes a novel Runge-Kutta Convolutional
  Compressed Sensing Network (RK-CCSNet). In the sensing stage, RK-CCSNet
  applies Sequential Convolutional Module (SCM) to gradually compact
  measurements through a series of convolution filters. In the reconstruction
  stage, RK-CCSNet establishes a novel Learned Runge-Kutta Block (LRKB) based on
  the famous Runge-Kutta methods, reformulating the process of image
  reconstruction as a discrete dynamical system. Finally, the implementation of
  RK-CCSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on influential benchmarks with
  respect to prestigious baselines, and all the codes are available at
