abstract: "Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is a multi-task
  learning problem that aims to detect different audio events and estimate their
  corresponding locations. All of the previously proposed SELD systems were
  based on human-extracted features such as Mel-spectrograms to make the
  prediction, which required speciﬁc prior knowledge in acoustics. In this
  report, we investigate the possibility to apply representation learning
  directly to the raw audio and propose an end-to-end sample-level SELD
  framework. To improve generalization, we applied three data augmentation
  tricks: sound ﬁeld rotation, time masking and random audio equalization. The
  proposed system is evaluated on the TAU-NIGENS Spatial Sound Events 2021
  development dataset. The experimental results will be submitted to DCASE 2021
  challenge task 3."
